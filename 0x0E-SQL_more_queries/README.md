### Description
Addtional database and SQL concepts: managing user privileges, `PRIMARY KEY`/`FOREIGN KEY`, querying multiple tables, `JOIN`s and `UNION`s. 

### Provided File(s)
* [`hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql`](./hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql) [`hbtn_0d_tvshows_rate.sql`](./hbtn_0d_tvshows_rate.sql)

## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. My privileges!
Write a script that lists all privileges of the MySQL users `user_0d_1` and `user_0d_2` on your server (in `localhost`.)

File(s): [`0-privileges.sql`](./0-privileges.sql)

### :white_check_mark: 1. Root user
Write a script that creates the MySQL server user `user_0d_1`.
* `user_0d_1` should have all privileges on your MySQL server
* The `user_0d_1` password should be set to `user_0d_1_pwd`

### :white_check_mark: 2. Read user
Write a script that creates the database `hbtn_0d_2` and the user `user_0d_2`.
* `user_0d_2` should have only `SELECT` privilege in the database `hbtn_0d_2`
* The `user_0d_2` password should be set to `user_0d_2_pwd`

Based on this [video](https://youtu.be/Z_cX3bzkExE) and [presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmcd/how-sqlite-works/master/how-sqlite-works.pdf), write a blog post to explain to your mother “How Do SQL Database Engines Work?”. Your blog post should contain:
* an introduction
* complete explanation
* examples (not the same as the video)
* diagrams
* a summary/conclusion

Your posts should have many code/output examples to illustrate what you are explaining, and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.
